  <!-- what is global execution context -->
   In in Global execution context we have to phases like creation phase and execution phase.
   In creation phase , we used to allocate the memory to the variables and function definitions are allocated to the name of the function.
   in creation phase, the exact values are not assigned and undefined values are assigned to the variables.
    
   In execution phase ,the exact values are assigned to the variables instead of undefined values.
   no changes in function until it is called.

  <!-- function execution context -->
  Here also we have two phases like creation and execution phase and it is similar to the global execution context but it will execute 
  the function definitions like it executes the contain inside the function.
  when we call the function ,the function will be call and give the result to the desired variables.


  <!-- calling stack -->
  IN STACK the operations will be stored from the bottom to top . and it follows the last in first out rule in STACK
  example is showed in js
